# Contributing to Classy

Looking to contribute something to Classy? We would love to have you involved!

To make the process as painless as possible, we have just a couple of guidelines
that should make life easier for everyone involved.

## Pull Requests

If you know exactly how to implement the feature being suggested or fix the bug
being reported, please open a pull request instead of an issue. Pull requests are easier than
patches or inline code blocks for discussing and merging the changes.

If you can't make the change yourself, please open an issue after making sure
that one isn't already logged.

## Suggest Enhancements

Please [check existing enhancements](https://github.com/cloudkite/classy/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open)
Before submitting your feature request. If it already exists you can vote for it by adding a +1

## Reporting issues

Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. Please [check existing bugs](https://github.com/cloudkite/classy/issues?&page=1&state=open) before submitting a new issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved but has not been released yet.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Try to include the minimum amount of code and stylesheet needed to reproduce the issue.

## Coding standards

### Whitespace

 * Spaces, not tabs.
 * Make liberal use of vertical whitespace to divide code into logical chunks.
